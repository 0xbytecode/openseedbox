- PlanSwitch.addMessage should String.format() the message and replace {message_id} with the id of the message (for use in auto-dismissing messages)
- Need to implement an hourly Job that reverts any partial plan changes after 2 days (to free up slots)
- Admin - auto update nodes, ssh in and git pull
- Node: ping admin when it restarts so that admin can start the daemons
- Set default ratio to 2.00
- Push transmission configuration changes to nodes
