DONE - User switcher for admin
DONE - Status pages for job queue details (admin only) - just to keep track of last time job ran / any exceptions
DONE - Page render stats in the footer
DONE - When adding to group, allow the creation of a new group
DONE - Allow select multiple groups using shift
DONE - Allow group action - "Download all as Zip"
IMPOSSIBRU - Make 'available' show node free space if the plans total space is '-1'
DONE - Show total up/ratio when seeding

- Job that goes through and cleans up any 'waiting to add'/'waiting to remove' torrent events more than 10mins old
- Implement resource constraints

- Create queues for adding torrents to transmission and removing torrents from transmission - to make page reloads faster (dont rely on transmission-daemon to be quick, its bloody slow especially when writing to encfs)
- Better unit tests
- Maybe a task that cleans up torrents that are present in transmission but not in the database


Maybe Never:

- Implement deluge or rtorrent backend - transmission is retardedly slow when theres slow hard disks (due to IO thread and RPC thread being the same)
